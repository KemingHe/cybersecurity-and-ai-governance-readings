## Significance

<!-- 
Write exactly 3 sentences (~40 words total, <5s read time), each on separate line:

CONTENT: Extract specific numbers/features/findings from briefing doc (adapt to document's unique value)

INDUSTRY: Current context driving adoption - use actual briefing threats/trends, not generic statements

CAREER: Target specific roles/skills this content advances - based on document focus, not boilerplate

Use blank lines between the 3 sentences. Adapt examples below to your briefing doc - avoid copy-paste templates. You must maintain overall section coherence while communicating critical points concisely and effectively.
-->

[Extract specific details: e.g., "introduces 6 new functions" OR "reveals 50% credential-based incidents" - adapt pattern to your document]

[Current context: e.g., "As cloud adoption accelerates" OR "While supply chain attacks rise" - use actual briefing drivers]

[Target roles: e.g., "equips governance professionals" OR "advances threat analysts" - match document's focus area]
