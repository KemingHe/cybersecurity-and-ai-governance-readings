## Significance

This NIST framework establishes a 7-step process with new "Prepare" phase, integrating security and privacy risk management across three organizational levels.

As supply chain attacks and privacy regulations intensify, federal agencies must implement structured risk management while enterprises adopt these proven methodologies.

The framework equips Authorizing Officials, Risk Executives, and CISOs with essential processes for advancing in governance and continuous authorization roles.
