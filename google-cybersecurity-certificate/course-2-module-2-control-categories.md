# Cybersecurity Control Categories and Types

> Adopted on 2025-09-01 by Keming He from [[Google Cybersecurity Certificate Course 2 Module 2](https://www.coursera.org/learn/manage-security-risks/supplement/I8hEO/more-about-security-audits)]

## Control Categories

### Administrative/Managerial Controls

Administrative/Managerial controls address the **human component** of cybersecurity. These controls include policies and procedures that define how an organization manages data and clearly defines employee responsibilities, including their role in protecting the organization.

_While administrative controls are typically policy based, the enforcement of those policies may require the use of technical or physical controls._

### Technical Controls

Technical controls consist of **hardware and software solutions** such as firewalls, intrusion detection systems (IDS), intrusion prevention systems (IPS), antivirus (AV) products, encryption, etc. Technical controls can be used in a number of ways to meet organizational goals and objectives.

### Physical Controls

Physical controls include door locks, cabinet locks, surveillance cameras, badge readers, etc. They are used to limit physical access to physical assets by unauthorized personnel.

## Control Types

These controls work together to provide defense in depth and protect assets:

| Type | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| Preventive | To **prevent** an incident from occurring in the first place |
| Corrective | To **restore** an asset after an incident |
| Detective | To determine whether an incident **has occurred or is in progress** |
| Deterrent | To **discourage attacks** |

## Examples

Review the following charts for specific details about each type of control and its purpose.  

### Administrative Control Examples

| Name | Type | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Least Privilege | Preventative | Reduce risk and overall impact of malicious insider or compromised accounts |
| Disaster recovery plans | Corrective | Provide business continuity |
| Password policies | Preventative | Reduce likelihood of account compromise through brute force or dictionary attack techniques |
| Access control policies | Preventative | Bolster confidentiality and integrity by defining which groups can access or modify data |
| Account management policies | Preventative | Managing account lifecycle, reducing attack surface, and limiting overall impact from disgruntled former employees and default account usage |
| Separation of duties | Preventative | Reduce risk and overall impact of malicious insider or compromised accounts |

### Technical Control Examples

| Name | Type | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Firewall | Preventative | To filter unwanted or malicious traffic from entering the network |
| IDS/IPS | Detective | To detect and prevent anomalous traffic that matches a signature or rule |
| Encryption | Deterrent | Provide confidentiality to sensitive information |
| Backups | Corrective | Restore/recover from an event |
| Password management | Preventative | Reduce password fatigue |
| Antivirus (AV) software | Corrective | Detect and quarantine known threats |
| Manual monitoring, maintenance, and intervention | Preventative | Necessary to identify and manage threats, risks, or vulnerabilities to out-of-date systems |

### Physical Control Examples

| Name | Type | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Time-controlled safe | Deterrent | Reduce attack surface and overall impact from physical threats |
| Adequate lighting | Deterrent | Deter threats by limiting “hiding” places |
| Closed-circuit television (CCTV) | Preventative/Detective | Closed circuit television is both a preventative and detective control because it’s presence can reduce risk of certain types of events from occurring, and can be used after an event to inform on event conditions |
| Locking cabinets (for network gear) | Preventative | Bolster integrity by preventing unauthorized personnel and other individuals from physically accessing or modifying network infrastructure gear |
| Signage indicating alarm service provider | Deterrent | Deter certain types of threats by making the likelihood of a successful attack seem low |
| Locks | Deterrent/Preventative | Bolster integrity by deterring and preventing unauthorized personnel, individuals from physically accessing assets |
| Fire detection and prevention (fire alarm, sprinkler system, etc.) | Detective/Preventative | Detect fire in physical location and prevent damage to physical assets such as inventory, servers, etc. |
