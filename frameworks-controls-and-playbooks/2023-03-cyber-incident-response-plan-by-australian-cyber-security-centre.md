## Significance

Establishes comprehensive 5-stage incident response framework addressing over 1,500 cyber security incidents ACSC responded to annually, featuring dedicated Cyber Incident Response Teams (CIRT) and Senior Executive Management Teams (SEMT) with 24/7 reporting capabilities and structured post-incident reviews using the PPOSTTE methodology.

As malicious cyber activity against Australian organizations increases in frequency, scale, and sophistication while many incidents remain preventable through Essential Eight security practices, organizations face individual responsibility for developing tailored incident response capabilities beyond government support.

This guidance empowers incident response teams, security managers, and business continuity professionals to integrate cyber incident planning with existing emergency management frameworks, establish evidence collection procedures, and implement structured learning cycles for organizational resilience.
