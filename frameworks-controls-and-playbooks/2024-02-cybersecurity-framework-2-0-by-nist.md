## Significance

This NIST framework introduces the new GOVERN function among 6 core functions, adds Quick Start Guides for smaller organizations, and integrates supply chain risk management throughout 4 implementation tiers.

As supply chain vulnerabilities escalate and cybersecurity governance demands increase, organizations must adopt accessible frameworks that bridge executive and operational levels.

The guidance equips executives, boards of directors, and risk managers with essential processes for advancing in enterprise risk management integration and cybersecurity program leadership.
