## Significance

Establishes 6-phase incident response framework addressing $200,000 average ransom payments through offline backup strategies, immediate system isolation protocols, and defence against double extortion tactics where attackers steal data before encryption to coerce payment.

As threat actors monitor victim communications to undermine recovery efforts while Ransomware-as-a-Service enables low-skilled criminals to purchase malware from dark web developers, traditional perimeter defenses prove insufficient against sophisticated supply chain attacks.

This Canadian government playbook equips security teams with specific controls including network segmentation, application allow lists, and Business Impact Analysis techniques to prioritize critical system recovery and prevent reinfection through remediated entry points.
