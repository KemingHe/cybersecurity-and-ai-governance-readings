## Significance

Defines a 4-layer AI TRiSM framework where the top two new layers are consolidating into a distinct market segment, predicting that 80% of unauthorized AI transactions through 2026 will stem from internal policy violations rather than external attacks.

As GenAI democratization accelerates enterprise AI adoption while weak information governance emerges as the primary obstacle to safe deployment, organizations urgently need unified runtime inspection systems to prevent data oversharing and harmful AI outputs.

Empowers AI leaders, security teams, and risk management professionals to establish comprehensive governance policies and implement layered TRiSM technology while maintaining critical independence from single AI model providers.
