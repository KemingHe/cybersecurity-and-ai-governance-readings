## Significance

This Google Cloud report reveals weak credentials drove over half of Q2 2022 incidents, 65% resulted in cryptomining, and 87% of malware samples used fraudulently obtained legitimate certificates.

As APT groups scale operations targeting SSO environments and cloud service accounts, organizations must implement collective defense strategies to counter state-sponsored threat actors.

The threat intelligence equips cloud security analysts, identity management specialists, and incident response professionals with essential insights for advancing in modern cloud threat detection and mitigation roles.
