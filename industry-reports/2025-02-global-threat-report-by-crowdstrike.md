## Significance

Reveals adversary breakout times reached all-time low of 48 minutes with 79% malware-free detections, while vishing attacks surged 442% and China-nexus activity increased 150% as threat actors adopt generative AI across nation-state, eCrime, and hacktivist operations.

As enterprising adversaries operate with business-like efficiency and leverage AI force multipliers to bypass traditional defenses, cloud environments face escalating threats with valid account abuse comprising 35% of incidents targeting SaaS applications and identity systems.

This intelligence empowers threat hunters, SOC analysts, and cloud security professionals to prioritize real-time detection capabilities, identity-centric defenses, and AI-native security strategies against rapidly evolving adversary tradecraft.
