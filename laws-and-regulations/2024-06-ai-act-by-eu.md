## Significance

Establishes the world's first binding horizontal AI regulation through 4-tier risk-based framework with penalties up to â‚¬35 million or 7% of worldwide turnover, setting 10^25 FLOPs threshold for systemic-risk general-purpose AI models requiring enhanced oversight.

As powerful generative AI systems proliferate globally without comprehensive governance frameworks, the need for balanced regulation protecting fundamental rights while fostering innovation becomes increasingly critical for establishing international AI safety standards.

This legislation empowers AI compliance professionals, risk management specialists, and policy experts to navigate the emerging global AI regulatory landscape while ensuring organizational readiness for mandatory EU market requirements.
