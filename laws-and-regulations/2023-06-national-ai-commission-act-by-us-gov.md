## Significance

Establishes a 20-commissioner independent bipartisan commission with structured 18-month reporting timeline to develop binding risk-based AI regulation framework categorizing applications by unacceptable, high, limited, and minimal risk levels.

As AI systems evolve into powerful general-purpose technologies requiring comprehensive oversight, current federal AI governance remains fragmented across agencies without unified regulatory approach or adequate enforcement mechanisms.

This legislation empowers AI policy professionals, government regulators, and compliance specialists to navigate the emerging federal AI regulatory landscape while ensuring balanced innovation and risk mitigation strategies.
