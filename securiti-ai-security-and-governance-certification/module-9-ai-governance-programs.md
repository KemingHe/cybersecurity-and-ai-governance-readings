> **Retrieved on**: 2026-01-07 by Keming He from [Securiti - AI Security & Governance Certification - Module 9 - AI Governance Program and Management](https://education.securiti.ai/certifications/ai-governance/ai-governance-program-management/ai-governance-program-and-management/)

## Definition

An AI governance program operationalizes AI governance through structured policies, processes, and practices grounded in applicable legal and regulatory frameworks. It manages AI throughout its lifecycle — from discovery through deployment to retirement — ensuring AI benefits society while managing associated risks.

## Four Building Blocks

| Building Block | Key Functions |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Model Discovery** | Catalog models, versions, approval status, training data, fairness scores, and algorithm versioning |
| **Model Consumption** | Map business use cases to approved models and track lifecycle stages (approvals → deployment → retirement) |
| **Continuous Monitoring** | Detect adversarial attacks, hallucinations, accuracy drift, and performance degradation; enforce security policies |
| **Risk Management** | Triage incidents, analyze root causes, integrate with ticketing systems (Jira, ServiceNow), and assess compliance with frameworks |

## Implementation Framework

Successful implementation requires:

1. **Governance Structure**: Define program scope, select governance model, and establish qualified team
2. **AI System Classification**: Categorize by _risk level_ (unacceptable, high-risk, limited-risk, minimal-risk)
3. **Use Case Management**: Identify AI actors, approve technologies, and document AI initiatives
4. **Data Governance**: Implement systematic processes for data integrity and security within AI systems
5. **Assessment Protocols**: Conduct impact, risk, and vendor assessments at appropriate lifecycle stages
6. **Training and Feedback**: Build AI literacy and integrate continuous improvement mechanisms

## Regulatory Example: EU AI Act

The EU AI Act establishes a comprehensive governance model requiring:

- **Classification**: Risk-based categorization of AI systems (unacceptable use, high-risk, limited-risk, minimal-risk)
- **Obligations**: Transparency, human oversight, data governance, technical documentation, accuracy, robustness, cybersecurity
- **High-Risk Requirements**: EU database registration, conformity assessments, post-market monitoring
- **Enforcement**: Penalties up to €35M or 7% of global revenue for major violations

## Business Impact

Unregulated AI development creates regulatory exposure, reputational damage, and consumer harm. Effective governance programs:

- **Mitigate Risk**: Prevent financial penalties and brand damage through proactive compliance
- **Enable Compliance**: Streamline adherence to frameworks through standardized documentation and processes
- **Build Trust**: Foster stakeholder confidence through transparent, accountable AI practices
- **Drive Efficiency**: Reduce operational friction via clear approval workflows and systematic monitoring
