## Significance

This NIST research establishes 7 fundamental tenets and 3 core logical components (Policy Engine, Policy Administrator, Policy Enforcement Point) implementing "never trust, always verify" through contextual trust algorithms.

As traditional perimeter defenses fail against lateral movement attacks in BYOD and multi-cloud enterprises, organizations must adopt resource-focused security architectures.

The frameworks equip security architects, identity management specialists, and risk professionals with essential knowledge for designing zero trust implementations and hybrid deployment strategies.
